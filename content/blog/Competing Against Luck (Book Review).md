I found myself reading "Competing Against Luck" over the last few days. As opposed to a direct recommendation or any fine-grained research, I came across it slightly randomly (I believe from a hacker news comment).

The book presents one sensible-sounding framework for "innovation" (read: UX/product design and marketing) that I actually quite like -- it's common sense of the "hard-to-distil" kind, and I like the approach (outlined below). The problem, however, is the comically poor standard of evidence presented for the ideas. Some of the arguments are so weak as to call into question the merit of anything else in the book. While reading it, I repeatedly found myself thinking "if these stooges believe this, they could believe anything". 

Perhaps amusingly, the "stooges" in question are vastly successful -- the principal author is [Clayton M. Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen), who's a senior professor at Harvard Business school, has been on the cover of Forbes, and [invented the term disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation). Nonetheless, I think the problems with the book speak for themselves, and I'll go on to outline what specific epistemic mistakes the three authors make whilst describing some of the useful material.

## Jobs to be done

The core idea of the book the "jobs to be done" framework. It suggests that you consider the goods and services produced by your business as potential "hires" that customers will make in specific circumstances to make "progress" in their lives. The framing is a bit weird, but I actually think the strange new use of language is an advantage. It encourages more focus, drawing the mind towards the customer actually wants and reducing the odds of distraction by internal vanity metrics (of both the institutional and personal kinds)[^0]. 

The other key idea that's put front and centre by this worldview is segregating your market by the end use-case of the product ("job" in the lingo) as opposed to customer demographic. This is a great insight, and one that clearly seems to be working for pharmaceutical companies, that will [famously](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35091242) offer the same painkiller in different packaging for different use-cases (e.g. back pain v.s. headache). 

Unfortunately, however, this does just seem to be a rehash of standard ideas from the UX literature; particularly notions from "human-centred design". [The design of everyday things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) is a classic in the area that goes much further in its analysis of how to assess user requirements for a specific task.

Another issue is that because this relatively simple insight (focus on what the customer aims to achieve) is glorified with both its own "framework" and a book, you're encouraged to adopt it wholesale and ignore other key factors. It seems pretty apparent that customer goals are just one axis along which you should think about marketing - demographic factors aren't just going to go away; and the framework just isn't rich enough to capture all the complexity needed to reach the glorious [disciminating monopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discriminating-monopoly.asp) which every tech company seems to dream of.

Nevertheless, the book does have several good examples of what it means to be customer-focused. I particularly liked the material on Intuit's QuickBooks. That app has a big form that users have to fill in, and the firm frequently solicited customer feedback on what information needed to be input. This lead to spiralling complexity that distracted from the core job of *just getting my taxes done*. New management leads to a focus on auto-filling based on previous year's filings and other information sources (online account details etc) that was much more successful[^1] than catering to customer requests for increased flexibility.

## Issues

There are several other equally interesting anecdotes, but overall I'd be lying if I said I liked the book.

One of the more annoying aspects is a continuous effort to shove good existing ideas into the framework without any reference to the original. There are a bunch of examples throughout, but one of the silliest is that [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) is rebranded as “*The Fallacy of Active Versus Passive Data*" for no good reason.

Apart from this, there is also rather little link between the anecdotes provided and the core thesis that the jobs-to-be-done framework will improve business performance. The worst supporting argument in the book is based on margarine. First Christensen outlines how he took a jobs-based worldview to present to the upper-management:

> “I was so sure of the power of this insight that we presented this thinking to the Unilever executives ...
> Alas, the conversation did not go well. Perhaps we didn’t have the right language at the time to explain our thinking, but the Unilever executives in the room were not moved by what we were trying to say. I actually called an early break and suggested we just move on to a new topic.”

He then outlines the difficulty that Unilever had over the next few years with the "yellow-fats" section of the business, before closing out the chapter with:

> “But I can’t help but wonder how a different lens on the competitive landscape may have altered Unilever’s path.”

The logic endorsed is, at heart, "This company didn't follow my approach, and it didn't work out for them. This is supporting evidence for the merit my approach". Similarly, we can imagine saying "Johnny didn't eat his carrots, and Johnny was hit by a bus. Better eat your carrots!". It's not evidence at all. Whilst I can see the value of the original anecdote as an illustration that not everyone will be receptive to the approach, attempting to use arguments of the form $\left( \neg A \rightarrow \neg B \right) \implies  (A \rightarrow B)$ badly damages my opinion of the whole book. For those who care, a valid equivalence is transposition, which notes $\left( \neg A \rightarrow \neg B \right) \implies  (B \rightarrow A)$. These are very much not the same. There is a classic example that [fire implies oxygen] is equivalent to [no oxygen implies no fire], but [no oxygen implies no fire] does **not** imply that [oxygen implies fire].

Several other stories in the book provide only fairly weak support for the framework:

> “He didn’t use the language at the time, but in hindsight, Huber says, OnStar succeeded because it focused relentlessly on the Job to Be Done. Everything fell into place from there."

Not exactly [preregistering your hypothesis!](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/more-and-more-scientists-are-preregistering-their-studies-should-you)

## Closing thoughts

Overall, "Competing against luck" feels like an effort to re-brand some old ideas and advertise Christensen's consulting firm. It provides relatively little compelling evidence for whether the ideas actually work, but does have some fun stories about big business. There can, however, be a lot of merit in common sense and the language presented is pretty compelling, so I think I'll try and adopt some of it in future. Overall, it's probably worth buying and reading quickly, but not to be taken too seriously.
