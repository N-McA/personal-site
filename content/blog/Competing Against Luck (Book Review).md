I found myself reading "Competing Against Luck" over the last few days. As opposed to a direct reccomendation or any fine-grained research, I came across it slightly randomly (I believe from a hacker news comment).

The book presents one sensible-sounding framework for "innovation" (read: UX design and marketing) that I actually quite like -- it's common sense of the "hard-to-distill" kind, and I like the approach (outlined below). The problem, however, is the comically bad evidence presented for the ideas. Some of the arguments are so weak as to call into question the merit of anything else in the book. While reading it, I repeatedly found myself thinking "if these stooges believe this, they could believe anything". 

Perhaps amusingly, the "stooges" in quesion are vastly successful -- the principal author is [Clayton M. Christensen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen), who's a senior professor at Harvard Business school, has been on the cover of Forbes, and [invented the term disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation). Nonetheless, I think the errors in the book speak for themselves, an I'll go on to outline what specific epistemic mistakes the three authors make whilst outlining some of the useful material.

## Jobs to be done

The core idea of the book the "jobs to be done" framework. It suggests that you consider the goods and services produced by your business as potential "hires" that customers will make in specific circumstances to make "progress" in their lives. The framing is a bit weird, but I actually think that's a major advantage as it encourages more focus due to the unfamiliar use of language, drawing the mind towards the customer actually wants and reducing the odds of distraction by internal vanity metrics (of both the institutional and personal kinds) [0]. 

The other key idea that's put front and center by this worldview is that it may be sensible to segregate your market by the end use-case of the product ("job" in the lingo) as opposed to customer demographic. This is a great insight, and one that clearly seems to be working for pharmaceutical companies, that will [famously](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35091242) offer the same painkiller in different packaging for different use-cases (e.g. back v.s. womb pain). 

Equally this does just seem to be a re-branding of standard ideas from the UX literature; particularly notions from "human-centered design". [The design of everyday things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) is a classic in the area that goes much further in it's analysis of how to assess user requirements for a specific task; but that field is mired in it's own overwrought terminology.

The other issue is that because the relatively simple insight (focus on what the customer aims to achieved) is glorified with a framework and a book, it might rob you of some flexibility. It seems pretty apparent that customer goals are just one axis along which you should think about marketing - demographic factors aren't just going to go away; and the framework just isn't rich enough to capture all the complexity needed to reach the glorious [disciminating monopoly](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discriminating-monopoly.asp) which every tech company (cough uber) seems to dream of.

The book does have several good examples of what it means to be customer-focused; I particularly liked the some of the material on Intuit's QuickBooks - customer feedback on what information needed to be input lead to a spiralling complexity that distracted from the core job of *just getting my taxes done*. New managent lead to a focus on auto-filling based on previous year's fillngs and other information sources (online account details etc) that was much more successful [1] than catering to customer requests for increased flexibility.

This framework seems like a nice reminder of that -- Jim wants to buy a milkshake to drink on the way to work, he doesn't care much 

## Issues and Errors

> “I was so sure of the power of this insight that we presented this thinking to the Unilever executives ...
> Alas, the conversation did not go well. Perhaps we didn’t have the right language at the time to explain our thinking, but the Unilever executives in the room were not moved by what we were trying to say. I actually called an early break and suggested we just move on to a new topic.”

> “But I can’t help but wonder how a different lens on the competitive landscape may have altered Unilever’s path.”

[0] Particularly amongst technical folks, there's often this delusion that customers will care about your underlying stack. They really, really don't. 

[1] According to the book, no specific metrics given.
